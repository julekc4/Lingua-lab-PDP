# [Project Name] - Web-based Audio & Video Transcription, Translation, and Text-to-Speech Application

### Overview
**[Project Name]** is a web application that leverages artificial intelligence to provide transcription, translation, and text-to-speech services for short audio and video files. Accessible through any web browser, this application allows users to upload media, choose a preferred language and voice, and process content instantlyâ€”no software installation required. The platform is ideal for users needing transcripts, translations, or voice-overs in alternate languages.

### Purpose
This project aims to develop a user-friendly platform for transcription, translation, and text-to-speech capabilities. Using AI technology, **[Project Name]** enables fast and accurate processing of audio content, benefiting users who require easy access to language-agnostic audio for short videos and audio files.

### Features and Functionality

#### Core Features
- **File Upload**: Users can upload their own audio or video files via a simple web interface.
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Converts audio into text in the original language.
- **Translation**: Translates the transcript into three specified languages, making the content accessible to a broader audience.
- **Text-to-Speech Voice-over**: Generates voice-overs in the selected language, allowing users to listen to translated audio in a preferred voice.
- **File Download**: Users can download the modified audio or video with the new voice-over.

#### Additional Options
- **Language Selection**: Choose from three languages for translation and voice-over.
- **Voice Customization**: Select from a range of voices for a personalized experience.

### Target Audience
**[Project Name]** is designed for individuals who frequently interact with audio and video content:
- **Target Users**: People who listen to audio files or watch short videos
- **Use Case**: Users who need accessible translations, transcripts, or voice-overs in another language

### Key Product Benefits
- **Web-based Platform**: No software installation; accessible from any browser.
- **AI-Powered Efficiency**: Uses artificial intelligence for fast and accurate transcription, translation, and voice generation.
- **Easy Access to Multilingual Content**: Instantly process and download content in multiple languages.

### Project Phases
The project development will be divided into the following stages:
1. **User Interface Development**: Design and implement the web interface for file uploads.
2. **Speech-to-Text Module**: Convert uploaded audio into text.
3. **Translation Module**: Translate transcriptions into three specified languages.
4. **Text-to-Speech Module**: Generate voice-overs in the chosen language.
